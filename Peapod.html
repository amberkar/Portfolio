                <p style="margin-top:3%;line-height:1.5">
                    This study was my signature project during my summer internship with Peapod. I joined Peapod at a time when the Product team was being built from the ground up and when the online grocery industry was becoming increasingly competitive. My key findings from this study helped to inform new designs on Peapod’s website. I cannot publish my findings and recommendations due to the confidentiality of this study. However, I will provide an overview of my process.

                        <p style="text-transform:uppercase;margin-bottom:-2%;font-weight:800;color:#3186d2">My Role</p>
                    <h2 style="color:#ffffff">Designed and conducted user testing, engaged stakeholders and presented the insights to key leaders in the organization.</h2>
                    </div>
                <h2 style="margin-top:10%;">Content of Test</h2>
                <p style="margin-top:3%;line-height:1.5">
                  At first, I engaged the product manager to get a better understanding of potential product pain points and also read through user voice cases as well. I explored the online grocery delivery space and also engaged stakeholders to determine fellow competitors. I developed the below research questions to guide my study.
                </p>
              <p> 1) What factors influence how users search for grocery items online? </p>
              <p> 2) What difficulties if any do users experience when setting up a delivery time?</p>
              <p> 3) What do users perceive as strengths of competitors sites? </p>

                  <h2 style="margin-top:10%;"> Creating a Scenario and Tasks</h2>
                  <p style="margin-top:2%;;line-height:1.5">
                  I created the scenario the user was shopping for items for a summer barbecue, to get the user in the proper frame of mind. The tasks and scenario were centered around the research questions I created and also accounted for having users explore the wide range of products Peapod and competitors offered. I had users add perishable, and non-perishable goods to their cart to see what factors may impact their experience. Additionally, users searched for and add the same items to their cart on Peapod’s site and the two other competitor sites.</p>

          <h2 style="margin-top:10%;">Screening Users</h2>
            <p style="margin-top:2%;;line-height:1.5">
            I utilized UserTesting.com to run the usability tests remotely and help to screen participants. I screened users based on their location, to account for areas were Peapod and competitors delivered to. Also, I screened to see if users had shopped at any of the three online grocers before. I only allowed first-time users to all three sites to participate in the study in order to eliminate any bias.
            </p>
            <h2 style="margin-top:10%;">Analyzing Data</h2>
              <p style="margin-top:2%;;line-height:1.5">
                I watched the user testing videos numberous times and took detailed notes on each session accounting for qualatative and quantative data. I utilized affinity mapping to visalize patterns and ultimately structure key findings.
              </p>
                      <h2 style="margin-top:10%;">Presenting Solution</h2>
                          <p style="margin-top:2%;;line-height:1.5">
                             Finally I presented my study to key stakeholders in the organization. My presentation detailed my process and key findings and recommendations. Additionally, as I stated at the begining Peapod was just building their product team when I joined as an intern. This was a great opportunity for my to demonstrate the value of UX research and design and engage with a diverse group of stakeholders.
