                <p style="margin-top:3%;line-height:1.5">
                    This study was my signature project during my summer internship with Peapod. I joined Peapod at a time when the Product team was being built from the ground up and when the online grocery industry was becoming increasingly competitive. My key findings from this study helped to inform new designs on Peapod’s website. I cannot publish my findings and recommendations due to the confidentiality of this study. However, I will provide an overview of my process.

                    <h2 style="color:#ffffff">Designed and conducted user testing,engaged stakeholders and presented the insights to key stakeholders and leaders in the organization.</h2>

                <p style="margin-top:3%;line-height:1.5">
                    At first, I engaged the product manager to get a better understanding of potential product pain points and also read through user voice cases as well. I explored the grocery delivery space and also engaged stakeholder to determine two other competitors to test against Peapod. I developed the below research questions to guide my study.

                <div class="insight-block">
    			           <h1 style="margin-top:5%;">Insight 1</h1>
    			              <p class="micro">Most users indicated they believed they were living in their space short term, so they purchased items that were easily “movable”.</p>

                     <div class="insight-block">
         			           <h1>Insight 2</h1>
         			              <p class="micro">Since space is limited finding items that are decorative and functional is difficult.</p>
         		             </div>
                         <div class="insight-block">

                                <p style="margin-bottom:10%;" class="micro"> Having items that could adapt to multiple contexts and areas was important.</p>

                  <h2 style="margin-top:10%;"> Narrowing the open problem space</h2>
                  <p style="margin-top:2%;;line-height:1.5">
                    Our affinity mapping activity helped to get everyone on the same page from a very broad problem. However after the affinity mapping activity we still had two problem statements.We then conducted concept testing using concept cards on 50 users. We showed users the two cards and answered questions about the two products and And then consolidated the results to finalize on a product direction.</p>

        <p style="text-transform:uppercase;margin-bottom:-2%;font-weight:800;color:#3186d2">Design Direction</p>
    <h2 style="color:#ffffff">Focus on developing a lighting solution that is both functional by providing tailored lighting while providing a decorative element.</h2>
    </div>

</div>

          <h2 style="margin-top:10%;"> What are the different settings that would make lights more functional and interactive at all hours of the day?</h2>
            <p style="margin-top:2%;;line-height:1.5">
              We started cardboard prototyping around making a light case that was easy to connect/re-connect, adaptable to a user’s enviornment and was decorative in nature. Initially, we started with a hexagon shape but realized that an isosceles trapazoid allowed for more shapes and was more stable.

            <h2 style="margin-top:10%;">User testing low fidelity prototypes</h2>
              <p style="margin-top:2%;;line-height:1.5">
                We wanted to present low fidelity prototypes to get feedback from users early. We wanted to make sure that the magnetic sides were interactive and intuitive. Also we wanted to test two different adhere to wall options. The first option was with a sticky adhesive back that would adhere to any flat surface the other was a powerful magnetic tack.
              </p>
              <div class="insight-block">
                   <h1 style="margin-top:5%;">Insight 1</h1>
                      <p class="micro">Users enjoyed the playful element the magnets provided and loved making different shapes.</p>
                   </div>
                   <div class="insight-block">
                       <h1>Insight 2</h1>
                          <p style="margin-bottom:10%;" class="micro">Users preferred the sticky adhesive since it could adhere to multiple surfaces included walls and brick.</p>
                       </div>
                       <h2 style="margin-top:10%;">High Fidelity Light Case Prototyping</h2>
                         <p style="margin-top:2%;;line-height:1.5">
                           Once we pieced together a general shape we utilized 3D printing to develop several high-fidelity iterations of the light case. We needed to make sure the lid fit tightly to the base to account for users attaching and re-attaching the device to different surfaces. We also utilized different plastic materials to make sure the lid’s plastic was durable while also being translucent.

                      <h2 style="margin-top:10%;">User Testing Voice Commands With Google Home</h2>
                          <p style="margin-top:2%;;line-height:1.5">
                             After we finalized the light casing it was time to finalize the commands we used for Google Home. We tested with 5 participants initially seeing if they could discover any of the commands on their own and then provided the voice commands we already had programmed.
                          </p>
                          <div class="insight-block">

                                  <p class="micro"> Reduce the number of commands so users did not have to remember too many.</p>
