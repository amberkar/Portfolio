                <h2> Design a household product that enables more efficient and satisfying use of a user’s living space.</h2>
                <p style="margin-top:3%;line-height:1.5">
                    As a part of a class called integrated product design, we were assigned a task to design a product that enabled more efficient and satisfying use of a user’s living space. We were a team of 6, all from different backgrounds, each one with special skills. We had to research, design, manufacture, brand and sell a product in 3 months.
                </p>
                <h2 style="margin-top:10%;">Understanding how our users engaged with their current living environment</h2>
                <p style="margin-top:3%;line-height:1.5">
                    We conducted 28 user interviews both remote and in person to better understand how users engage with their space and any challenges they may encounter. I led developing an interview protocol that was structured based on our initial research questions. After our interviews, we utilized affinity mapping to uncover insights and provide a direction heading into our brainstorming and ideation phase.

    			              <p class="micro">Most users indicated they believed they were living in their space short term, so they purchased items that were easily “movable”.</p>

         			           <h1>Insight 2</h1>
         			              <p class="micro">Since space is limited finding items that are decorative and functional is difficult.</p>

                                <p style="margin-bottom:10%;" class="micro"> Having items that could adapt to multiple contexts and areas was important.</p>

                  <p style="margin-top:2%;;line-height:1.5">
                    Our affinity mapping activity helped to get everyone on the same page from a very broad problem. However after the affinity mapping activity we still had two problem statements.We then conducted concept testing using concept cards on 50 users. We showed users the two cards and answered questions about the two products and And then consolidated the results to finalize on a product direction.</p>

    <h2 style="color:#ffffff">Focus on developing a lighting solution that is both functional by providing tailored lighting while providing a decorative element.</h2>
</div>

          <h2 style="margin-top:10%;"> What are the different settings that would make lights more functional and interactive at all hours of the day?</h2>
            <p style="margin-top:2%;;line-height:1.5">
              We started cardboard prototyping around making a light case that was easy to connect/re-connect, adaptable to a user’s enviornment and was decorative in nature. Initially, we started with a hexagon shape but realized that an isosceles trapazoid allowed for more shapes and was more stable.

            <h2 style="margin-top:10%;">User testing low fidelity prototypes</h2>
              <p style="margin-top:2%;;line-height:1.5">
                We wanted to present low fidelity prototypes to get feedback from users early. We wanted to make sure that the magnetic sides were interactive and intuitive. Also we wanted to test two different adhere to wall options. The first option was with a sticky adhesive back that would adhere to any flat surface the other was a powerful magnetic tack.
              </p>
              <div class="insight-block">
                   <h1 style="margin-top:5%;">Insight 1</h1>
                      <p class="micro">Users enjoyed the playful element the magnets provided and loved making different shapes.</p>

                   <div class="insight-block">
                       <h1>Insight 2</h1>
                          <p style="margin-bottom:10%;" class="micro">Users preferred the sticky adhesive since it could adhere ti multiple surfaces included walls and brick.</p>
                       </div>
                       <h2 style="margin-top:10%;">High Fidelity Light Case Prototyping</h2>
                         <p style="margin-top:2%;;line-height:1.5">
                           Once we pieced together a general shape we utilized 3D printing to develop several high-fidelity iterations of the light case. We needed to make sure the lid fit tightly to the base to account for users attaching and re-attaching the device to different surfaces. We also utilized different plastic materials to make sure the lid’s plastic was durable while also being translucent.
                         </p>
                      <h2 style="margin-top:10%;">User Testing Voice Commands With Google Home</h2>
                          <p style="margin-top:2%;;line-height:1.5">
                             After we finalized the light casing it was time to finalize the commands we used for Google Home. We tested with 5 participants initially seeing if they could discover any of the commands on their own and then provided the voice commands we already had programmed.
                          </p>
                          <div class="insight-block">

                                         We had to sell our product in a final exhibition. It had online as well as a physical presence. Shown in the next section are links to the final website followed by physical trade show photos. You can view the branding website and the final product.
