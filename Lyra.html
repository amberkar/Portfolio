              <h2>Design a household product that enables more efficient and satisfying use of a living space</h2>
                <p style="margin-top:3%;line-height:1.5">
                    As a part of a class called integrated product design, we were assigned a task to design a product that enabled more efficient and satisfying use of a user’s living space. We were a team of 6, all from different backgrounds, each one with special skills. We had to research, design, manufacture, brand and sell a product in 3 months.
                </p>
                <h2 style="margin-top:10%;">Understanding how users engaged with their current living environment</h2>
                <p style="margin-top:3%;line-height:1.5">
                    We conducted 28 user interviews both remote and in person to better understand how users engage with their space and any challenges they may encounter. I led developing an interview protocol that was structured based on our initial research questions. After our interviews, we utilized affinity mapping to uncover insights and provide a direction heading into our brainstorming and ideation phase.

         			              <p style="margin-bottom:5%;line-height:1.5" class="micro">Since space is limited finding items that are decorative and functional is difficult.</p>

                  <p style="margin-top:2%;;line-height:1.5">
                     We utilized affinity mapping to structure key findings from the qualitative data gathered from our user interviews. Our affinity mapping activity helped to get everyone on the same page from a very broad problem. However, after the affinity mapping activity we still had two problem statements.We then conducted concept testing using concept cards on 50 users. We showed users the two cards and collected qualitative and quantitative data and consolidated the results to finalize our product direction.</p>

                    <p style="margin-top:2%;;line-height:1.5">We started cardboard prototyping the light case to design for both a standalone and adhere to wall option. We experimented with different sizes and shapes before settling on an isosceles trapezoid. The shape of the trapezoid provided for stability on a desk and on a wall. Additionally, the versatility of the shape allowed for multiple design configurations.</p>

                    <h2 style="margin-top:10%;">How will the modules attach to one another?</h2>
                    <p style="margin-top:2%;;line-height:1.5"> After deciding on a shape we prototyped different module attachment solutions. We knew the attachment solution needed to be easy to attach and detach while also providing a strong connection.We decided on placing strong magnets in the interior of the light case. This allowed for a strong attachment with little effort from the user.</p>

            <h2 style="margin-top:10%;">User Testing Low Fidelity Prototypes</h2>
              <p style="margin-top:2%;;line-height:1.5">
                We presented our low fidelity cardboard prototypes to users to get feedback about our design early. Our usability testing was focused on seeing if the magnetic sides were intuitive and interactive. Also, we presented users with two separate adhere to wall options. One option was with a versatile stick adhesive pad that could adhere to multiple surfaces without damaging the wall. The other option was a magnetic tack that easily adhered to the wall with minimal damage.

              <div class="insight-block">
                   <h1 style="margin-top:5%;">Insight 1</h1>
                      <p class="micro">Users enjoyed the playful element the magnets provided and loved making different shapes.</p>

                          <p style="margin-bottom:10%;" class="micro">Users preferred the sticky adhesive since it could adhere to multiple surfaces included walls and brick.</p>
                       </div>
                       <h2 style="margin-top:10%;">High Fidelity Light Case Prototyping</h2>
                         <p style="margin-top:2%;;line-height:1.5">
                           Once we pieced together a general shape we utilized 3D printing to develop several high-fidelity iterations of the light case. We needed to make sure the lid fit tightly to the base to account for users attaching and re-attaching the device to different surfaces. We also utilized different plastic materials to make sure the lid’s plastic was durable while also being translucent.
                         </p>
                       </div>
                     <h2 style="margin-top:10%;"> What are the different settings that would make lights more functional and interactive at all hours of the day?</h2>
                     <p style="margin-top:2%;;line-height:1.5">Once we finalized the light case design we shifted our focus towards developing tailored light settings. We reflected back on pain points illustrated by our initial user interviews to guide our brainstorming session. Having the ability to change light intensity and complete tasks at different times of the day were important to users. Below are three key settings that guided our voice UI integration with Google Home.</p>
                     <p> 1) Light intensity</p>
                     <p> 2) Warm to cool lighting</p>
                     <p> 3) Controlling modules together and separate</p>

                  </div>
                      <h2 style="margin-top:10%;">User Testing Voice Commands With Google Home</h2>
                          <p style="margin-top:2%;;line-height:1.5">
                             After we finalized the light casing it was time to finalize the commands we used for Google Home. We tested with 5 participants initially seeing if they could discover any of the commands on their own and then provided the voice commands we already had programmed.
                          </p>
                          <div class="insight-block">
                               <h1 style="margin-top:5%;">Insight 1</h1>
                                  <p class="micro"> Reduce the number of commands so users did not have to remember too many.</p>
                               </div>
                               <div class="insight-block">
                                   <h1>Insight 2</h1>
                                      <p style="margin-bottom:10%;" class="micro">Make the commands more conversation like and less technical.</p>
                                   </div>
                                 </div>
                               <h2 style="margin-top:10%;">Finalizing the Voice UI</h2>
                               <p style="margin-top:2%;;line-height:1.5"> Our data from user testing help to drive our voice UI design. We simplified the commands themselves by associating certain settings with a color like natural or cool blue instead of having the user say increase intensity by x. Below is a demo showcasing Lyra's integration with Google Home.</p>
