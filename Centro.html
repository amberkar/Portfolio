                <p style="margin-top:3%;line-height:1.5">
                  As part of a class called Needs Assessment and Usability Evaluation, I had the opportunity to work on a semester-long client-based project. My team had the opportunity to advise Centro Community Partners about the user experience of their mobile application Centro a Business Planning Application. Centro Community partners is a non-profit organization whose mission is to help underserved low-income entrepreneurs build and establish successful businesses.

                <h2 style="margin-top:10%;">Problem</h2>
                <p style="margin-top:3%;line-height:1.5">
                  Centro's mobile application is currently facing problems around the conversion rate at which their users complete all the steps to result in a business plan. Only 39% of users who begin activities with Centro's application are completing all 6 steps.

                  <h2 style="margin-top:10%;"> User Interviews</h2>
                  <p style="margin-top:2%;;line-height:1.5">
                    Our team conducted 6 interviews in order to further understand the needs of potential users of Centro. We interviewed three female entrepreneurs, and one male to understand the process they took, and their experiences in creating their business plans. We also interviewed an employee at Centro who closely works with the users in workshops to get his perspective on the users of the application. Qualitative data collected from the interviews were organized using Affinity Mapping to extract key findings. We developed personas based on the data collected in our interviews. After studying the background and motivations of our interviewees we developed 2 personas, Dolores and Anna.</p>

          <h2 style="margin-top:10%;"> Heuristic Evaluation</h2>
            <p style="margin-top:2%;;line-height:1.5">
              As a guideline, we used Jacob Neilson’s Heuristics and each member of our team individually analyzed Centro against Neilson’s guidelines to see if they violated any usability Heuristics.Then as a team we discussed and decided what kind of questions we wanted to investigate within each of the 9 above-listed categories.  Then we completed an individual evaluation looking at the questions we developed as a team. We gave each question a score ranging from 0 to 4, in which 0 advised of no usability problem while 4 advised of a severe usability problem. Below are three of our key finding for this stage of our research.

            <h2 style="margin-top:10%;">Usability Testing</h2>
              <p style="margin-top:2%;;line-height:1.5">
                Finally, it was time to conduct usability testing in order to observe user’s behaviors while interacting with Centro and acquire information about user’s attitudes towards the application as well as collect qualified data about their experience. We recruited 5 users without a formal business background who were in the preliminary stages of creating their business.
