                <p style="margin-top:3%;line-height:1.5">
                  As part of a class called Needs Assessment and Usability Evaluation, I had the opportunity to work on a semester-long client-based project. My team had the opportunity to advise Centro Community Partners about the user experience of their mobile application Centro a Business Planning Application. Centro Community partners is a non-profit organization whose mission is to help underserved low-income entrepreneurs build and establish successful businesses.
                </p>
                <h2 style="margin-top:10%;">Problem</h2>
                <p style="margin-top:3%;line-height:1.5">
                  Centro's mobile application is currently facing problems around the conversion rate at which their users complete all the steps to result in a business plan. Only 39% of users who begin activities with Centro's application are completing all 6 steps.

                  <p style="margin-top:2%;;line-height:1.5">
                    Our team conducted 6 interviews in order to further understand the needs of potential users of Centro. We interviewed four female entrepreneurs, and one male to understand the process they took, and their experiences in creating their business plans. We also interviewed an employee at Centro who closely works with the users in workshops to get his perspective on the users of the application. We utilized affinity mapping to structure the qualitative data we collected from our interview and extract key findings.We developed personas based on the data collected in our interviews. After studying the background and motivations of our interviewees we developed 2 personas, Dolores and Anna.</p>

This way they understand what the output will look like, and visualize their goal as they go through the different steps in the Centro application. With the current design of the application, users do not know what the business plan output produced by the application looks like before they start the process.</p>

Centro has MBA volunteers that help to produce the actual business plan for each user based on what they input into the app. However, the application does not mention this personal component. Centro should consider introducing the user to their MBA advisor through the app, to may the experience more personable.</p>

In order to address this issue, the video chat capability can be extended to solely focus on financial literacy for their users. Allowing the user to schedule sessions with MBA volunteers would create flexibility, so the user can work according to their schedule while still successfully completing their business plan.</p>

          <h2 style="margin-top:10%;"> Heuristic Evaluation</h2>
            <p style="margin-top:2%;;line-height:1.5">
              As a guideline, we used Jacob Neilson’s Heuristics and each member of our team individually analyzed Centro against Neilson’s guidelines to see if they violated any usability Heuristics. As a team we discussed and decided what kind of questions we wanted to investigate within each of the 9 above-listed categories. Then we completed an individual evaluation looking at the questions we developed as a team. We gave each question a score ranging from 0 to 4, in which 0 advised of no usability problem while 4 advised of a severe usability problem. This stage of our research helped to determined areas of the app to test during usability testing.

            <h2 style="margin-top:10%;">Usability Testing</h2>
              <p style="margin-top:2%;line-height:1.5">
                Finally, it was time to conduct usability testing in order to observe user’s behaviors while interacting with Centro and acquire information about user’s attitudes towards the application as well as collect qualified data about their experience. We recruited 5 users without a formal business background who were in the preliminary stages of creating their business.
